- **AR Glasses Support**: Visual cues for preferred brands, allergen warnings, and navigation assistance
- **Real-time Environmental Monitoring**: Live crowd and sound level tracking with predictive analytics

### Technical Excellence
- **Full-Stack Implementation**: React/TypeScript frontend with Supabase backend integration
- **Real-time Data**: WebSocket connections for live store conditions and user synchronization
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines)
- **Advanced State Management**: Context-based architecture with persistent user preferences

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
